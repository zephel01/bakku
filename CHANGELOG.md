# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Multiple key slots per repository: `key add` / `key list` / `key remove`
  (all `--json`). Every slot wraps the same master key with its own password,
  so losing one key still lets you open the repository with another. The last
  remaining slot cannot be removed. Key files gained a `type` field; v0.1.0
  key files (no `type`) are read as `password` slots (backward compatible).
- Flexible password resolution: `--password-command` global flag and
  `password_command` config key (global and per-`[[dest]]`) run an external
  command (1Password `op`, Bitwarden `bw`, `pass`, …) whose first stdout line
  is the password.
- OS keychain integration via `github.com/zalando/go-keyring` (cgo-free):
  `password store` / `password forget` save and remove the repository password
  in the macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service.
  Missing entries or a headless host silently fall through to the next source.
- Password resolution order is now: `BAKKU_PASSWORD` → `--password-file` →
  `--password-command` → config `password_command` (per-dest → global) → OS
  keychain → interactive prompt.
- YubiKey challenge-response key slots (`yubikey-chalresp`): `key add
  --yubikey [--yubikey-slot N]` registers a passwordless slot using the
  YubiKey's HMAC-SHA1 OTP challenge-response (same scheme as KeePassXC),
  driven through `ykchalresp` (yubikey-personalization) or `ykman`
  (yubikey-manager) — no cgo, no new Go dependency. The global `--yubikey`
  flag unlocks with a registered YubiKey instead of a password; without the
  flag, bakku auto-falls-back to YubiKey unlock if password resolution fails
  and a YubiKey tool/slot is available. `key list` shows the slot type; `key
  add --yubikey` and `key remove` warn (and `key remove` requires `--force`)
  when an operation would leave the repository with no password slot at all.
  See docs/quickguide.md § 13 for setup.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-03

Initial release.

### Added

- Content-addressable repository format: keyed FastCDC chunking, BLAKE3
  content addressing, zstd compression, AES-256-GCM encryption with an
  argon2id-wrapped master key (repository format version 1).
- Core commands: `init`, `backup` (incremental, dedup), `restore`,
  `snapshots`, `ls`, `diff`.
- Retention & maintenance: `forget` (GFS keep-last/daily/weekly/monthly/
  yearly/tag), `prune` (crash-safe repack + reclaim), `check
  [--read-data]`, `verify-restore`.
- Storage backends: local/NAS (`file://`), S3-compatible (`s3://`), SFTP
  (`sftp://`), Google Drive (`gdrive://`), Dropbox (`dropbox://`), SMB
  (`smb://`), all with retry/backoff.
- Destination management (`dest add/list/remove`) and TOML configuration.
- OS metadata: uid/gid, xattrs, hard links (Linux/macOS); long paths and
  `FILE_SHARE_DELETE` reads (Windows).
- Scheduling: `schedule install/uninstall/status` via systemd timers,
  launchd, or Windows Task Scheduler.
- Webhook notifications (Slack / Discord / JSON) for `backup` and `prune`.
- CI (3-OS test matrix, 6-target cross-build) and release automation
  (`scripts/build-release.sh`, binaries attached on `v*` tags).
